get rid of dummy reset functions for unallowed discrete transitions.
investigate just how badly we need the trichotomy axiom
remaining arithmetic lemma: exp_pos
thorough review and general cleanup
more kinds of flow (sine, etc)
more flow combinators like scale that preserve invertability (this would amount to "a little language" for flow)
documentation(!)
allow multiple discrete transitions between a given pair of locations
generalization from squares to polyhedra defined by linear boolean predicates and all that stuff
get rid of binary_setoid_morphism and unary_setoid_morphism.
