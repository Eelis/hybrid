get rid of dummy reset functions for unallowed discrete transitions.
automate hints
alternative to hints mechanism? named constants perhaps
investigate just how badly we need the trichotomy axiom
shorten thermostat development
get rotators running again
remaining arithmetic lemmas
thorough review and general cleanup
more kinds of flow (sine, etc)
more flow combinators like scale that preserve invertability (this would amount to "a little language" for flow)
documentation(!)
allow multiple discrete transitions between a given pair of locations
generalization from squares to polyhedra defined by linear boolean predicates and all that stuff
extraction
