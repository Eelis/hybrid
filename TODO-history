extraction: "out of the box" extraction compiled with optimizing compiler
  of ocaml verifies Thermostat in ~1sec. on a machine where it takes Coq
  ~10sec. Profiling extracted program reveals that most of the time is
  spent in arithemetic operations from BinPos, so there seems no "cheap"
  way to improve performance more (like getting rid of unneccessarily big
  equalities on inductive types).
